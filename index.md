Like any decent story, the history of Innovative Reel Technologies started with an American dream and a deep passion for success.

When Penn Reels—a local Pennsylvania reel company—closed their Hegins, PA plant and began outsourcing more parts and production overseas, several of the employees came to work for Solar Innovations<sup>®</sup>. Greg Header, an avid outdoorsman and the company president, began talking with some of the workers and brainstormed the idea of making an American made fishing reel. Between the experience of the workers and Greg’s passion for fishing, the idea of IRT was born.

The goal for IRT was to create unique and efficient fishing reels that could be customized with dedicated fishermen in mind. We realized that each rod, reel, and piece of tackle had the potential to hold memories of monumental catches and great days spent with family and friends. During the creation process, IRT latched onto this idea, truly wanting to bring customers a durable reel for sport and hobby fisherman alike that could bring forth a lifetime of memories.

By 2006, IRT received its first patent for the Fishing Reel Leg Applied Powergrip™ and by 2007, Greg Header launched IRT officially. While other companies moved or outsourced their builders, IRT proudly kept engineering, development, and manufacturing right here in the US throughout the entire process. For over ten years, IRT has worked on development and patents to make some of the best fishing reels in the industry, and our team continuously tests and retests the products to make sure they are perfect.

Our staff and customers are a part of the IRT family, so we are constantly listening to their wants and needs to further improve our products. As a result, IRT has been built on listening to the anglers that work directly in the field. Our staff are some of the most dedicated individuals to ever work in the industry and it shows by the quality of the products that we produce.

Our all-American made reels are guaranteed to give you a one-of-a-kind fishing machine and experience with every purchase. Created from our patented precision manufacturing, our aluminum spinning reels are the best on the market today.

Since the first reel was sold in 2011, IRT has been pushing forward to consistently provide the best products in the industry to our customers. Our mission has always been to infuse the fishing reel industry with fresh new ideas, help consumers think outside of the box, and to produce top quality fishing products using all-American ingenuity. Our story is part of who we are as a company and we take pride in our humble beginnings and will continue to work every day to be the best that we can be.
