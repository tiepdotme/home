When Penn Reels—a local Pennsylvania reel company—moved their production from Hegins, PA to overseas, several of the employees came to work for Solar Innovations®. Greg Header, an avid outdoorsman and the company president, began talking with some of the workers and brainstormed the idea of making an American made fishing reel. Between the experience of the workers and Greg’s passion for fishing, the idea of IRT was born.

Between 2005 and 2007, IRT really began to come to life. The goal for IRT was to create unique and efficient fishing reels that could be customized with dedicated fishermen in mind. We realized that each rod, reel, and piece of tackle had the potential to hold memories of monumental catches and great days spent with family and friends. During the creation process, IRT latched onto this idea, truly wanting to bring customers a durable reel for sport and hobby fisherman alike that could bring forth a lifetime of memories.

By 2006, IRT received its first patent for the Fishing Reel Leg Applied Powergrip™ and by 2007, Greg Header launched IRT officially. While other companies moved or outsourced their builders, IRT proudly kept engineering, development, and manufacturing right here in the US throughout the entire process. While it took almost five years oFor over ten years, IRT has worked on  of development and patents to make some of the best fishing reels in the industry, and our team team took the time to continuously tests and retests the products to make them sure they are perfect.



Our all-American made reels are guaranteed to give you a one-of-a-kind fishing machine and experience with every purchase. Created from our patented precision manufacturing, our aluminum spinning reels are the best on the market today.

Since the first reel was sold in 2011, IRT has been pushing forward to consistently provide the best products in the industry to our customers. Our mission has always been to infuse the fishing reel industry with fresh new ideas, help consumers think outside of the box, and to produce top quality fishing products using all-American ingenuity. Our story is part of who we are as a company and we take pride in our humble beginnings and will continue to work every day to be the best that we can be.


## Mission
Our mission is to infuse the fishing industry with fresh ideas, help consumers think outside the box, and produce top quality fishing products — using all American ingenuity.

## Customer First 

IRT’s dedicated production and development teams work with our customers to provide the highest quality customer and product service in the industry today. Service provided by our expert personnel can include maintenance from normal wear and tear to severe damage from a rough fishing trip. We can also make adjustments to the drag, gear operation, and reel balance, just to name a few. We recommend the reel be sent to our home office in Pine Grove, Pennsylvania for an annual service depending on the amount of yearly use.

## Campus / Facility

IRT makes active strides to ensure not only the team and products reflect environmental sustainability, but the facility itself as well. The building is wrapped in a transom window pattern and includes a vast roof skylight that illuminates the first and second floor in order to utilize as much natural light as possible. 

Low VOC paint is used on the office walls, and high performing insulation is incorporated to maintain the building’s temperature. The floor is comprised of carpet and linoleum tiles that can be individually replaced and the ceiling is designed with exposed beams, allowing any lighting or wiring issues to be fixed with minimal maintenance. IRT recycles as many items as possible, including food compost and manufacturing materials, along with standard recyclable items like plastic, paper, and cardboard. The recycled compost is used to fertilize the lawn and onsite greenhouses, which are fed by cisterns that collect rainwater. 

The office space itself has even been furnished with used, recycled, and reconditioned desks, chairs, and cubicles. Even the bathrooms are designed with green in mind: low flow toilets, recycled content paper products, and foam soap, which requires far fewer chemicals than standard soap. Since standard trash bags are not recyclable, IRT eliminated them in all trash cans, with the exception of the cafeteria. For cleaning, vinegar and water are the products of choice to keep IRT sparkling. Living and working green both at home and the office is embedded in IRT’s way of life.
