They have the right tools to complete service work and only use the highest quality lubricants, designed specifically to withstand  the harsh saltwater fishing environment. Our staff will carefully inspect all of the reels components and notify you if anything is found to be at the service limit. Proper service helps prevent costly repairs, or even worse, the loss of a trophy catch! -->

Innovative Reel Technologies, Ltd. suggests that customers complete regular maintenance of their reels. Frequency will be determined by overall use and standard wear and tear on the reel. 

If the reel is used primarily for salt water fishing, additional maintenance may be required to maintain product appearance and function. Immediately upon returning from a salt water fishing trip, IRT reels should be cleaned in warm, soapy water. A light film of IRT oil (provided with each reel) should be applied to all exterior surfaces and moving parts to ensure proper function.

Reels should be dried thoroughly after each use. It's also recommended that reels be stored in the supplied case.

Annual service completed by the IRT team is also recommended. Please [contact us](/info/contact/contact-us) if you're ready for your reel to be serviced.
