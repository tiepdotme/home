PINE GROVE, PA – All American Reviews [recently published a post](https://allamericanreviews.com/best-fishing-reels/) on the best fishing reels made right here in the United States and IRT<sup>®</sup> was featured. 

According to the post, 10 reels were picked and IRT was the only spinning reel on the list. With IRT<sup>®</sup>'s superior features standing out from the crowd, there were quite a few areas where IRT<sup>®</sup> was highlighted. IRT<sup>®</sup>'s customization capabilities, the flexibility of functioning well in both salt or freshwater, our aluminum machined spool, our reversible handle, and of course the strength and comfort behind our Spin Power Grip were a few mentioned positives.

President Greg Header was also quoted in the article: “IRT chooses to make its reels right here in the U.S., not only because we take pride in being American, but also because we care about creating American-made jobs. We want to use our grassroots beginnings to provide top-quality service to fellow Americans and bring customers the best products possible. With our patented technology and constant desire to improve through customer feedback, we truly aim to capture the American spirit. IRT takes pride in being the best that we can be, all while helping our customers and team achieve their full potential in the sport.”
