This Thanksgiving at IRT Reels, we would like to extend our thanks to the supportive community, our past and future customers, and all of our dedicated team members.

In observance of the Thanksgiving holiday, IRT Reels is closed today, Thursday, 11/24/16 and operating with limited staffing on Friday, 11/25/16 and Monday, 11/28/16. Our team members are enjoying the holiday with their families and loved ones. During this time of peace and celebration, we sincerely hope that you are able to spend time with those you love and reflect on everything that makes you thankful. Happy Fishing!
