Anglers all over the the world are falling in love with IRT Reels. From the marshes of Florida to the ocean depths surrounding New Zealand our reels have been thoroughly tested and the anglers want to show off their impressive catches. 

Innovative Reel Technologies wants to help show off these catches too. The following process details how you and us will accomplish this goal.

#### Step One

First you must sign up for the IRT Newsletter. This grants us consent to use your images on our website. When a photo is submitted, we'll cross reference the submitter's email, Twitter, or Facebook account with what we have on file. If everything checks out, we'll feature your image on our site.

#### Step Two 

Go to Imgur to upload your photos. Here you can add captions, hashtags, and even tag us by including @irtreels in the comment. Also in your comment, if you would include the location of the catch, the reel series you used, and any other information you believe people might find interest in. 

#### Step Three

Copy the URL from Imgur and send it to us. You can send us the link through either Facebook or Twitter. 
Twitter: Tweet or DM the link to @IRTreels
Facebook: Post the link on the IRTreels page, make a status update tagging us, or send it to us in a message.

If you make the post public and it's an appropriate picture, we might boost your post as to increase the aggregate audience. This will not only help us get more followers, but it'll also help you.

#### Summation

This process is designed to help IRT, IRT Pro Staff, and the IRT Family of customers connect and engage with each other online. The process also tries to maximize social exposure of your photography; the more people who see how much you love the reel the happier we become.

Now go out and catch some fish!
