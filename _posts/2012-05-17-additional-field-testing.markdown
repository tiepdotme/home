Innovative Reel Technologies, Ltd. is currently performing a series of field tests on our aluminum machined fishing reels. The latest testing adventure was performed when an IRT enthusiast went in pursuit of Drum fish.

These fish are feisty creatures that will fight with everything they have, which is quite a lot, to avoid being caught. Four Drum fish were caught, weighing in at forty, seventy-three, seventy-five, and eighty-five pounds. Each of the fights with these large fish lasted fifteen to twenty minutes, resulting in a bent net and three exhausted fishermen. Throughout this extremely fun yet challenging test, the IRT reel held up fantastically and proved the superiority of this precision manufactured aluminum machined reel.
