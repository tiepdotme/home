Innovative Reel Technoogies is in the final design stages of three new handle options available with the launch of the 600, 700, and 800 series reels.

The bullet handle with counterweight is designed to properly fit the hand of nearly any fisherman and always remain the "ready" position.

The convex handle will be available in two different styles including a troughs handle and a slotted handle.
