Innovative Reel Technologies, Ltd. is in the final stages of package development. There will be three packaging options available to customers with the purchase of a quality aluminum IRT reel.

For standard packaging, IRT provides a resealable cardboard box. For upgraded packaging options, both a plastic, watertight box and a commemorative stained hardwood box will be available for Innovative Reel Technology customers. Customers will be eligible to receive a microfiber reel cloth and reel grease depending on the packaging option selected through IRT.
