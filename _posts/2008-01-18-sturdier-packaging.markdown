Innovative Reel Technologies, Ltd. is in the process of changing the box design for our reels. Now the box being used for reel packaging is more structurally sound than the previous prototype and features a fully-removeable lid. This sturdier packaging will further protect the reel during shipping, ensuring that a superior, fully-functional aluminum machined reel is reaching our customers.

IRT reels are available with nearly limitless customization; please visit us again for further details.
