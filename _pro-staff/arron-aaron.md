Aaron specializes in light tackle and live baiting. Fly guys are definitely welcome. Tightline is user friendly with pop up cleats for no snags. The boat has plenty of room to fish all day so you can tell tales for a lifetime and maybe even catch dinner. 
 
Aaron is originally from VA Beach and has traveled and fished from the Carolinas to the Caribbean. He has caught everything under the sun from big blue marlin to bonefish. He started fishing with his father at the age of 10 when he saw his first blue marlin landed and has been hooked ever since.
