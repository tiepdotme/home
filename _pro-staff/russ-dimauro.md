Al has been making fishing lures since 1978 and has developed some of the most innovative lures in the business. His Gab’s Grabber Needle Fish lure was showcased as one of the Top 10 Best Classic Lures by the fishing tackle catalog, and Al’s newest lure, the Whip-It Eel, is his best invention yet. With a custom molded head with lifelike eyes and a shape that adds a natural swimming action, this jig and eel tail will surely help you catch anything from trout to tuna. Al’s lures are no match for any game fish in the USA or abroad.
