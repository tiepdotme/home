Iâ€™ve  been fishing since I can remember,  going out with my dad on his head boat during the summer or on the weekends.  First mate at the age of 14, I've had my captains license for 7 years now. Four years inshore working on my fifth, I've used alot of reels in my time. Since I've been introduced to the IRT team it's been a phenomenal experience to put these reels to the test. I specialize in redfish, black drum, cobia, trout and flounder but also catch sharks and rays with massive size. I'm now a captain for Reel Action charters in little river South Carolina. Can't wait to see what IRT Reel's come up with next, so I can find a worthy fish to put it to the test.
