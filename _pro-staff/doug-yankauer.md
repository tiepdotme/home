Doug has been fishing for over 60 years and currently living in the Dominican Republic. He has fished pretty much everything from small sweet water fish up to most [pelagic species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic_fish){: target="_blank"}. On the North Coast of the Dominican Republic he has *hooked* up with Marlin Chaser, a 31' custom catamaran, that operates out of Rio San Juan.
