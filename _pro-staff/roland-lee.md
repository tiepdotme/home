Fishing has and will always be my first passion. Ever since I was six when I saw my first little fish in a pond, all I could think about was how to catch them. From a ball of sewing thread and a bent sewing needle to 50 years later and custom building my own rods, Iâ€™ve endeavored to learn as much as possible about all kinds of fishing. Now with this blog I hope to slowly share the insights I have gained so that all may enjoy this amazing sport. I try to provide my little insights into how I catch fish. There are many opinions and methods and I do not claim to know them all. All I know is that they work for me fairly consistently. I really am not above learning something new and am always looking to improve on what I know so if you have something to share, please do!
