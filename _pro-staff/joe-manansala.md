[Joe Manansala](/about/pro-staff/joe-manansala/) and [Nina Ji](/about/pro-staff/nina-ji/), better known as Team Woozy have fished in fresh and salt water, from small streams to ocean canyons, as far afield as Alaska and the Caribbean. They have landed everything from bluegill and trout to sharks, tuna, and billfish and have competed and won in multiple tournaments such as the White Water Sportfish Challenge (1st and 2nd place). They are not professional fishermen, but are avid enthusiasts who fish strictly for fun. Joe was born and raised in Rhode Island and has fished in the Ocean State for some 35 years. Nina has been fishing in Rhode Island waters for over 14 years; she may be diminutive in size at 4 feet 10 inches but has landed many fish that are much larger than her.
