I was fortunate to grow up in an area with some very good trout and bass fishing opportunities, where I realized my love for fishing and fish in general, enough that my first jobs included working at the Local Commercial trout hatcheries. As time went on i absolutely fell head over heels with saltwater fishing, whether it was Surf, Pier, Charter, Head boat or private boats. My best memories I’ve had and continue to make are those spent with Family and Friends on the water fishing wherever and whenever for whatever after 40+ years of salt water fishing I’m proud to be a “Nomad” Fisherman and being part of IRT reels since the infancy.
