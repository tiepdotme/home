The Good Times is a 47 ft. custom-made Carolina boat owned and operated by Captain Andy Piland. Built on Roanoke Island by Sheldon Midgett and powered by a 700 HP Lugger, she can cruise at over 20 knots and is equipped with up-to-date electronics and all required USCG safety equipment.

She has a large cockpit equipped with a custom fighting chair and two companion chairs. The air conditioned salon is spacious with ample seating and storage for the anglers.

One of only 3 charters out of Hatteras Marina with a greenstick. Fishing with a greenstick is similar to kite fishing but also better. [Greenstick fishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green-sticking){: target="_blank"} allows the lures to be on the water without evidence of the fishing lines. Another benefit of the greenstick is you are not required to troll against the wind and if it is a calm day you can still fish with the greenstick.

Adequate iced fish storage is provided to ensure that your catch arrives at the dock in peak condition. Tackle, bait, and ice are supplied for you. You are responsible for bringing your own food, drinks, sunscreen, sunglasses, hat, jacket, and rain suit.

The Good Times has fished these waters since her inception, and is a proven fish raiser. Andy and his crew pride themselves on honesty and going the extra mile to make your trip a memorable one. The results will speak for themselves!

Let us be your Hatteras Fishing Charter.
