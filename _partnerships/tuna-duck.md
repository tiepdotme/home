The Tuna Duck is a 50' custom built Cape Hatteras charter fishing boat, designed specifically for fishing the offshore waters off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. 

The Tuna Duck was built in 1985 by Captain Buddy Cannady of Manteo, North Carolina. She was launched in April '85 and purchased in October of that year by Capt. Jerry Shepherd, the sole owner until 2007 when Capt. Dan Rooks joined Jerry as co-owner. Capt. Rooks has been her captain since that time.

In the continuing quest to offer a quality charter service, we are upgrading. Sound down acoustic insulation and climate control,will offer added comfort for our passengers .

It is configured with 2 fiberglass sailfish chairs and a Scopinich Bluefin Unlimited fighting chair. 

The heated salon has 2 large bench seats with thick cushions that encompass the entire starboard and port sides. There is plenty of room for coolers and other gear. The boat was named for the Cory's shearwater gull which is often seen feeding over schools of tunas. Captain Shepherd, who loves ducks and is quite a bird watcher, began calling them "tuna ducks". When he got his boat, he wanted an unusual name that everyone would remember. Hence the name Tuna Duck.
