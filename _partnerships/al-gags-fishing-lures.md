Al has been making fishing lures since 1978 and has developed some of the most innovative lures in the business. 

Al’s Gab’s Grabber Needle Fish lure was showcased as one of the Top 10 Best Classic Lures by the fishing tackle catalog.

Al’s newest lure the Whip-It Eel is his best invention yet, with a custom molded head with lifelike eyes and a shape that adds a natural swimming action to this jig and eel tail. 

From Trout to Tuna you will catch every game fish there is in the USA or abroad.
