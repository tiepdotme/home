The Machaca is a 36 ft. BHM that easily accommodates up to six passengers. Our trips include everything you will need for fishing, including bait, tackle, ice and filleting of catch.

We charter out of Falmouth Harbor on the south side of Cape Cod and out of Martha's Vineyard Island. Capt. Willy Hatch has provided professional charter services for over 20 years for anglers of any experience. 

Please bring whatever you plan on eating or drinking. We offer half-days, full days and overnight canyon trips.

We are available for tournaments and multi-day trips throughout the Cape & the Islands.
