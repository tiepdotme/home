Black Hole USA first introduced Black Hole "Cape Cod Special" Jigging & Popping Rods to US in 2010 (Special Design by [Kil Song](/about/pro-staff/kil-song/)).

We landed 1,000lb Bluefin Tuna on Stand up with the Cape Cod Special 450g Jigging Rod.

Many Fishermen started to promote our products to others after they tested the rods.

And now, "Black Hole" is well known as the "Light yet Strong and Powerful" fishing pole.
