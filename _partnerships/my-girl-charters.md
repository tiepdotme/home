Located just 15 minutes away from Annapolis and only an hour from Baltimore, Washington DC and Northern Virginia, My Girl Charters has become a preferred destination for tourists and locals in search of an unforgettable day outdoors. Take a look at the different the services we offer.

Fishing charters are thrilling adventures for anglers of all experience levels and ages. My Girl offers Chesapeake Bay fishing charters where our customers have the opportunity to catch a variety of fish, including striper, rockfish spot, perch and more.

We take our customers on our 35-foot Crusader (named “My Girl,” of course) decked out with the latest fishing equipment and boating technologies, including VHF, GPS, Loran and Chartplotter. “My Girl” is powered by a 300HP Cummins Diesel, is extremely comfortable, and even has an enclosed cabin with a fully enclosed private head.

Steve Murray, our beloved captain, has been fishing in the area for over 20 years, and while the GPS system and other technologies are nice, he could probably find the best fishing spots blindfolded! A member of the United States Coast Guard, Steve has both his captain license and his Maryland fishing guide license. Steve and his mate will surely make your day even more special, and they are there to help however they can, even if you have little to no fishing experience.

Fishing Charters are a wonderful endeavor for a variety of events, including but not limited to bachelor parties, corporate outings, family days, birthday parties and more. As well, they are a unique way to host a client or catch up with friends you may not have seen in a while.

Regardless of your age, we promise you will have a wonderful time on one of the fishing charters! For more information, remember to look at our fishing charters page.
