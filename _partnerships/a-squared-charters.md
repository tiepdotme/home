If you are looking for a world class fishing trip, you’ve come to right place. 

I have been fortunate to fish the Glades over the past 20+ years, and I can’t think of a better place to seek out such a variety of salt and freshwater fish. The minute my Dolphin Super Skiff hits the water up “front” or the “back” of Everglades National Park problems seem to quickly fade away! Everglades National Park has plentiful opportunities for both the seasoned angler and those seeking their first experience with world class bay or backcountry fishing. Folks from all over the world come to the Everglades seeking an opportunity to catch Redfish, Black drum, Snook, Tripletail, Sea Trout, Tarpon, among many other popular species.
