Brainstorming and incubation period.

When Penn Reels—a local Pennsylvania reel company—moved their production from Hegins, PA to overseas, several of the employees came to work for Solar Innovations®. Greg Header, an avid outdoorsman and the company president, began talking with some of the workers and brainstormed the idea of making an American made fishing reel. Between the experience of the workers and Greg’s passion for fishing, the idea of IRT was born.

Between 2005 and 2007, IRT really began to come to life. The goal for IRT was to create unique and efficient fishing reels that could be customized with dedicated fishermen in mind. We realized that each rod, reel, and piece of tackle had the potential to hold memories of monumental catches and great days spent with family and friends. During the creation process, IRT latched onto this idea, truly wanting to bring customers a durable reel for sport and hobby fisherman alike that could bring forth a lifetime of memories.
