description: We use our IRT reels quite a bit for vertical jigging, some of the toughest abuse that can be put on a spinning reel
---

The IRT Spinning reel was introduced to me by an employee of INNOVATIVE REEL TECHNOLOGIES by Jason on a charter, they were in the prototype phase and he wanted to test it out. Capt. Chris and I looked at the magenta spinning reel and thought, 'well this won't last very long with a big fish attached to the other end!' Boy, were we wrong! After Jason boated a few large King Mackerel and we saw how this reel performed, I was trying to purchase it before he got off the boat; however, it wasn't for sale yet since it was still in the testing phase...I had to have some of these reels, so I contacted IRT REELS and soon we received 2 of these reels. I was still concerned that they would have trouble holding up on a daily basis on a Charter boat as this is the next thing that's almost as hard on equipment as the ocean itself. Well, now it's 5 years later and they have most definitely been 'put to the test' and still stand up to the toughest fight with an Amberjack, Mahi-Mahi, or what ever else we challenge it to do.
            
We use our IRT reels quite a bit for vertical jigging, some of the toughest abuse that can be put on a spinning reel, and time and time again they come out on top boating trophy fish and creating lasting memories for our crew members!

I now tell my fishermen when they get a big fish hooked up to give it all you got, but, be careful. The reason to be careful is that they most likely can't stand the pressure very long that you can put on a fish with IRT REELS and as for the rods, well, when you buy a rod for these reels to go after big fish, just be sure to get a spare rod as well. You just might need it!!!!

These reels are top of the line, 2nd to none, and will not let you down when that trophy fish is on the other end of the line and superior performance matters most! Keep on building quality reels that perform great, and I will at least not have to worry about this piece of my tackle arsenal letting me down. Thanks guys, you build the best I have ever used!!! God Bless You All!!!
