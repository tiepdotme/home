Just wanted to share with you a pic of my first striper from the surf. 37 inches, 20 pounds off the surf in the Cape Henlopen park. I caught it on the first reel Greg gave me. I caught a shorter one on the newer reel as well as a much larger fish that snapped my line when I got it into the rolling surf.

LOVE THAT IRT REEL!
