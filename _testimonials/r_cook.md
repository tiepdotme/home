Absolutely loving testing your new fly reels! Chasing toothy fresh water monsters (Northern Pike) in Southern Alberta. In 28 years of slinging flys, I have never even seen let alone used a reel with such an incredible drag system! ZERO LAG or DELAY in the tension release and reel side drag adjustment so you NEVER have to push pause on the fight to adjust your tension. All you salt water fly folk, keep your eyes on these guys. You may never lose another Bone Fish or Permit due to that slight delay in you drag again! Did I mention the reel is made in the USA and it's machined NOT cast!  The name says it all: INNOVATIVE REEL TECHNOLOGIES! Oh yeah and to top it all off, the reel is Dead Sexy to boot! 
Keep up the great work!
