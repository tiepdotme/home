Hey [Greg [President of IRT]](/about/team),

You should know that your reels and our team placed 4th out of 68 teams in the Annual Bull & Cow. The fishing community has its ear turned to IRT. We will be fishing the the Mother's Day Dolphin Tourney, giving your gear further exposure. We will be one of two hundred boats. Keep you posted and forward pics.
