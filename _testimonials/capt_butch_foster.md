I truly do not see how [the reels] continue to take the abuse the big fish we catch with them continue to give them. If they were not precision designed with the best materials possible and built to the standards they are, they would have been "toast" a long time ago.
         
My biggest problem is keeping rods and line from breaking under the loads. To quote an old commercial, (I'm telling my age now), "they take a lickin'.... and keep on tickin'!!!" That reminds me, if you guys keep building reels of this quality, you need to design some rods for them that can hold up like the reels do!!!! I will have to say that you continue to amaze me with the reels you produce!!! [...] I am honored and humbled at the same time that you think enough of us to test your products. 

The reels stir up some excitement on the charter boat, especially after it whips a big fish's butt!! [...] I'm just excited about your Reels and the technology that you design into them. Again, do not hesitate to contact me if I can help in any way!!  

Fish On!!!!
