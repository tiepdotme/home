Here is the result of my first fishing trip with your reel. A nice 22lb Bull Dorado from the Bahamas. Wish the fish was larger to really test the reelâ€™s capability. I was pleased with the smooth operation and comfortable grip of the reel. The drag operation was smooth on the initial high speed run of the fish. The best feature of the reel is the fact that it is not reversible so it has a smoother cranking operation with no handle jerk action. Tuna season is approaching, so I am looking forward to seeing what level of punishment your reel can take.
