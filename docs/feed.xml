Now that the weather is cooling down, football should not be the only “F” word on your mind – the fishing is some of the best you can find. The nights are getting cooler, and the fish know what that means. To them, this signals the time to start eating for the long winter ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about what they are doing now. Bass are natural predators, they are going to follow baitfish. Most baitfish in lakes at this time will start heading to creeks and coves in order to feed-up, the bass will follow suit to feed on them. They will also start munching on crayfish more than normal now. One thing to pay close attention to is the color of the crayfish this time of year.  They begin molting for the fall, and will start to show an orange color. Crankbaits with the brown body, orange bottom work super in the fall.  I try and throw a lot of baits with some orange for this very reason. Top-water can also be electric this time of year. There is a new one on the market called a Whopper-Plopper, I recommend picking one up in (90) or (110) size in the “bone” color. It is a combination of a spook and buzzbait, just cast it out and reel it back. Tube baits and jigs also work great now, as the bass are looking to the bottom for crayfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panfish will begin eating as well; look in the ten to twelve foot range for them, as the sun comes up they will move closer to the bank. Some people like to use a bobber with a big leader. You can use a colorful jig head with a fat-head minnow, piece of worm, or a waxworm. They also become more aggressive again this time of year. Pay attention to trees that have fallen down in the water and rip-rap banks. They draw in bluegills and crappies this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catfish will continue their hunts at this time. Cutbait, nightcrawlers, chicken liver, and live bluegills are hard to beat. One thing to remember if you are fishing at night; don’t worry about casting out as far as you can, big cats often come in shallow searching for an easy meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog--chinook-salmon-underwater.png&quot; alt=&quot;chinook-salmon-underwater-photo&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid rounded float-left mr-4 mb-3&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time of year also signals something very important to a certain species. The urge to spawn hits the salmon in Lake Erie and Ontario now. This is the time of the year that the rivers and tributaries are lined with anglers looking to hook into one. If this is your first time, please do not think you will go up and be sore from catching fish. Like anything else, those who do catch them at will have practiced their trade. They know how to read the water, and what stages the fish are at. Please do your due diligence and research the area you will be fishing, and talk to those that do go fishing. They are the ones that can help you out the most at this time. Pulaski is a popular destination, as is Oswego N.Y., this time of the year. Once the salmon stop in early November, people go for the steelhead and trout that follow them and then feast on their eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will say, if you have never tried it and said you always wanted to, please make sure you go, get some friends, family members and make a trip. It is a blast; along with the fish catching and camaraderie, you will make memories that last a lifetime. My family has been doing it now for going on fifteen years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time, get out there and enjoy this great fall weather!&lt;/p&gt;

Here is a recent professional review of the IRT 500 Series Spinning Reel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello! My name is Russ Dimauro. I am a Senior Pro-Staff angler for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.algagsfishinglures.com/&quot;&gt;Al Gag Lures.&lt;/a&gt; I became aware of IRT REELS though my friend Kil Song, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jignpop.com/&quot;&gt;Black Hole U.S.A. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using the IRT500 to catch fish everyday for the last week. I’ve been catching loads of 30+ lb fish. The drag on the IRT500 works well very smooth and I’ve had it singing on several occasions! This reel is very comfortable to cast, lightweight and has great power. These fish have been caught using 4 oz jigs jigging the bottom with extreme current and it holds up excellent…lots of looks from other anglers and all comments have been positive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This reel packs a punch!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3803 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://www.innovativereeltechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/RDimauro2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RDimauro2&quot; width=&quot;408&quot; height=&quot;544&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRT500 feels a bit on the small side for canal fishing. With a current of 5 knots, pulling big fish can be a chore, but so far so good. I feel the IRT600 should be a focus for the Cape Cod Canal market. Most popular size for canal 6 and up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Every so often, we hear questions raised from customers and other fishermen and -women. To answer these, we turn to professional anglers with years of experience. This question is answered by IRT Pro Staff member Scott H.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm having some issues with knots in my line. I was told it could be caused by cranking the bail -- is this true?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Some knots in the line occur when the bail is cranked closed, but that isn’t the cause.  The best analogy I can think of is anti-lock brakes.  Some accidents occurred when people locked up their brakes - but the brake pedal wasn’t at fault.  The majority were caused by driving too fast, failing to drive defensively, and poor maintenance.  Anti-lock brakes help avoid some of those accidents, but they don’t prevent all of them because they don’t do anything about the underlying causes.  The real key is avoiding the situations that cause you to need to jam your brake pedal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am convinced that wind knots are caused, almost exclusively, by line twist and slack.  Cranking the bail closed can cause some momentary slack, especially when the line isn’t under the roller; and that can allow twist-loops to form.  But it’s the line twist that takes advantage of that slack to spin into a knot.  Manually closing the bail is focusing on when the knot occurs, and not why the knot occurs.  For guys fishing natural baits, manually closing the bail may stop most knots in the line from occurring.  But fishermen like me – who constantly cast lightweight lures into the wind – see wind knots occurring in many more ways.  For instance, if I am throwing a 1/4 oz. spoon, and I develop significant line twist, just lowering my rod tip can provide enough slack to allow a twist-loop to form.  If that gets reeled onto the spool, the next cast will create a knot.  The answer can’t be to quit throwing spoons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to reducing knots in the line, I believe, is minimizing the things that cause the line twist, and periodic maintenance. The key for you, I believe, is education. There are a lot of traditions and myths about wind knots, and a tendency for a lot of fishermen to blame it on the reel. Manually closing the bail may be a good technique for certain fishing styles, but it won’t eliminate all wind knot problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are a list of things that either cause line twist, or contribute to wind knots in some way.  When people are having serious wind knot problems, I’ve found that several or even all of these conditions are present at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improper spooling. &lt;/strong&gt; Most people know that spooling line onto the reel in the direction opposite from the way it came off the manufacturer spool will create line twist.  A lot of people don't know that an over-filled  spool will exacerbate a wind knot problem tremendously.  Put a mark an eighth of an inch or so inside the outside lip to tell people &quot;stop filling here&quot;, and you will reduce the wind knot problem.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry cranking a spinning reel.&lt;/strong&gt;  When you continue to turn the reel handle while a fish is taking drag, it automatically creates line twist.  But when a fish is sounding, or simply pulling just below the level to cause the drag to slip, a lot of novice fishermen, as well as some good fishermen, will crank the reel.  That added pressure will cause the drag to slip, and create the same line twist.  It's harder to recognize, because if they stop cranking they don't see any drag slippage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Casting into the wind.&lt;/strong&gt;  Most people recognize that they get knots when casting into the wind, which is why they call them wind knots.  Casting into the wind can cause slack, but it can also create some of the line twist.  Most don't notice that a lot of baits, natural and artificial, spin when cast into the wind.  The wind knot occurs on a single cast, but it is often the 30+ casts before that created the line twist that led to the knot.  Note that a swivel cannot do much to help prevent line twist that occurs when the line is in mid-air, and in a somewhat slack condition.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rod and eye issues.&lt;/strong&gt;  The size, height, and placement of rod eyes have a big impact on how line plays off the spool of a spinning reel.  If line twist is present, and the line slaps on the eyes (especially the first two) or if it slaps on the rod itself, it slows the line down.  The line behind it continues to move, and creates slack.  The line bunches, and the twist takes over and forms a knot.  Some rods are built without considering eye placement, and some rod/reel combos simply cause more line slap than most.  Often you can take a reel that is producing knots in the line, transfer it as-is to another rod, and the problem goes away or becomes much less.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swivels are also a part of the problem.&lt;/strong&gt;  Many people believe a swivel will prevent line twist, and they quit thinking about it.  But even good swivels will pick up debris like sand and grass.  Salt crystals form inside them as they dry.  They need to be rinsed, blown out, lubed, and manually rotated periodically or it is just like no swivel is present.  I have heard many people insist that they don't have line twist, because they always use a swivel.  And that leads them to conclude that something else must be causing their wind knot problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A certain amount of twist is almost unavoidable.  Sooner or later, you really need to stretch the line out (many methods) and remove the twist that has built up.  How often depends a lot on fishing style.  It’s a pain, but so is changing the oil in your car.  The difference is that there are people who will change your oil for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some people will disagree with the above.  But here is a test: whenever someone is having frequent problems with knots in the line, keep everything the same but change out the spool for one that is freshly and properly spooled with new line.  The wind knot problems will go away - at least for a while.  Doing several of the things listed above can cause line twist to develop pretty quickly.  But wind knots rarely occur with fresh, untwisted line, even in the wind.  The biggest caveat to that is that an over-filled reel, on top of a poorly-matched rod (eyes), can start causing wind knots right away.  That is because loose loops of line can spring off the reel, bunch up against the eyes, and turn into knots in the line almost instantly.  When cranking the bail closed is causing knots, the first place I would look is the amount of line on the spool.&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As the water gets warmer, the fish begin to come shallower in the water column. When the water gets into the 60’s the bass and panfish have one thing on their mind – spawning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now before the water gets up to the sixty degree mark, the fish are in what is called the pre-spawn stage. This means they are eating and gaining weight and strength for the upcoming spawn. It also makes them a lot easier to catch. Once they get into spawn stage, they will eat, but a lot of times it is to protect the nest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the bass. The smallmouth will spawn when water gets into the high 50’s. They like to spawn in eddies on rivers, and in or near marinas, marshes, docks on lakes. Largemouth will also seek some sort of shallow cover to spawn such as docks, logs, lily pads and any other cover they can seek out. Look for white spots on the bottom, this is an area where the fish have cleared the silt, sand on the bottom to find the hard bottom. This is where the female will lay her eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog--maa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fish&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid rounded float-right ml-4 mt-2 mb-3&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bass during these two periods are always eager to take a crankbait or soft plastic bait. It is tough for them to pass up a plastic stick bait like a Senko. Throw it out and let it flutter down and they often cannot resist it. A tube jig is another bait that just catches fish. If you do find a bass on a bed, bring your soft plastic on the bed and often times they will eat the bait immediately. There are times though, where the fish do not want anything to do with it. Always remember your states laws about fishing during the spawn. In some states you may not cast on a visible nesting bass. If your state does allow it, please get the fish right back in the water, so it can continue its circle of life in the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panfish, such as bluegills, sunfish, crappie bass, and perch, often can be taken on live bait. These are the fish you should be searching for in order to get a child hooked on fishing. They can provide hours of entertainment and fish catching pleasure. One of the easiest ways to get them is to use a piece of worm on a small #6 or #8 hook. One thing people do wrong is they will put an entire nightcrawler on a hook. This is too big of a meal for them. Simply cut a small piece of worm off and run it on the hook. Your fish landing success should go way up. A fathead minnow is another great bait for them. Perch and crappie will readily eat them at will.  If you want more of a challenge, a two inch twister tail grub, mepps spinner, or small spoon will take them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget our bottom feeders as well.  Catfish and carp are also on the hunt to find a meal as the water warms up.  Corn and doughballs are great for carp, and nightcrawlers, chicken liver and cut bait work well for catfish.  Picnic food like hotdogs and shrimp are also great for cats.  Some people like throwing a handful of corn out (chumming) or, like when I was a kid fishing in pits, throwing some bread out on the surface, and the carp would come up and slurp it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember, this is a great time to be fishing.  Please get a child out because it is a time they can enjoy great success, and also remember your elders.  There are plenty of our older generation who cannot get around as easy as they could, however if you asked them if they wanted to go I am sure many would love to take you up on the offer and tag along!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck out there, and keep fishin’!!&lt;/p&gt;

My name is Jeff C. and I am a bass fisherman.  I was born and raised in Schuylkill County, but I only recently learned about Solar Innovations&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and IRT reels from a childhood friend.  After visiting the company during the “off season”, I loved seeing new ideas in fishing! I’m looking forward to working with the company and finding ways to incorporate IRT reels into my style of fishing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a boat owner and tournament fisherman, I have plenty of experience on the water, both locally and in the surrounding area.  I have experience fishing Oneida Lake, the Thousand Islands, the Finger Lakes, the Chesapeake Bay, Lake Erie, and the Potomac in addition to the many smaller lakes throughout Pennsylvania, New York, and Canada. I am a member of the Sweet Arrow Anglers which is a local bass fishing club.  I also fish on the pro side of BASS Northern Open tour and the FLW BFL circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pro-staff/jeff_c_bass.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5 lb bass on the Potomac River&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid rounded float-right ml-4 mt-2 mb-3&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m not on the water for a tournament, my son and wife Weigh in on Lake Erie with the BASS Northern Open Enjoy going out on the boat with me.  My son, Justin, will be turning 8 soon.  I couldn’t be happier that at such a young age, he enjoys the sport as much as I do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fishing season will be upon us soon so don’t let it sneak up on you!  Here are some things you can do now to be ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Strip off all your old fishing line and fill your reels with new line. Once your spool is full, spray it with a line conditioner to help it come off the spool easier.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check any lures you have for rust, the hooks love to get rusty.  Replace any hooks that need replacing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Organize your tackle boxes. Empty them out and wipe everything down inside with a good general cleaner.  Combine hooks, weights, or anything else you can put in one package to save space.  Get rid of things that you no longer use, or that are no longer usable.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Clean up your rods!  Windex is great for wiping down the body of the rod.  It removes grime and leaves it shining.  Check the eyes of the rod by running a cotton ball over them.  If the cotton ball hangs up anywhere, you have need a new eye or else your line can fray and cut!  If your rod has a cork handle, and it is black from dirt or use, here are two good tips:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;#1. Get very fine sandpaper and use it on the cork, wipe it down afterwards with a wet cloth.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;#2 Use a wet Magic Eraser to wipe the cork. I use this method because it is quicker and less messy.  The dirt just wipes away leaving your rod looking good again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stock up on things you need now, often times over the winter things are on sale, once the season rolls around expect to pay full price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time, we will talk about getting your boat ready for the season!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep Fishin’&lt;/p&gt;

One day, before heading to Belmar, New Jersey, he handed me a blue and gold reel and said, “Give this a go on these Whopper Blues.” He then stated that his friend, Greg Header, had decided to venture into the reel business. I graciously accepted this reel, and the rest has become somewhat of a wild ride into the world of design, mechanics, and testing of these innovative reels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog--ross-scroble-blue-fish.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dead fish&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid rounded float-right ml-4 mt-2 mb-3&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I instantly became a believer in the performance and future of these reels. Countless trips were made to the Belmar Marina, where we became known as the guys with ‘those fancy reels.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the following years, I have used this same reel to catch hundreds of these large bluefish, as well as large striped bass throughout the Northeast. My reel is a prototype reel, and the ONLY service I have needed in 6+ years is to have a minor shim upgrade and a gear replacement due to overworking the reel on a 200 lb shark while jigging blackfin tuna off Hatteras, NC in Dec 2015. This 700 sized reel has made pretty work of many large game fish, as I’ve become more obsessed and devoted to fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2014, Scott arranged for me to test the 400 sized spinning reel. ‘TEST’ wasn’t really the word, in my opinion. I was now landing fish off of the beach and in the sound with a reel nearly half the size I had previously been using. Only time I had trouble was when I hooked into a skate the size of a Volkswagen, and any angler knows how that story ends. The 400 has become my favorite all around reel. Versatile off the beach and the perfect inshore weapon for big reds, sharks and cobias. Here are some exceptional catches on my IRT 400:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog--ross-shark.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Big Ol’ Biter in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina on IRT 400&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid rounded float-right ml-4 mt-2 mb-3&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog--ross-shark2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;One of many sharks landed on north facing beach off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid rounded float-right ml-4 mt-2 mb-3&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of many sharks landed on north facing beach off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, I now have the privilege of testing the IRT 300 size spinning reel. Salmon in Lake Michigan and redfish in Hatteras make this thing sing, but eventually the drag quits howling and the reel wins. I enjoy light tackle fishing with larger game, which makes this reel a perfect union in the style of fishing I’ve come to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog--ross-redfish.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;40lb red sight casted in a foot of water in Pamlico Sound, Hatteras, North Carolina&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid rounded float-right ml-4 mt-2 mb-3&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the most gratifying aspect of all of this is to be a part of something. Part of what IRT means and stands for: a collective comprised of friends, family, acquaintances, master anglers and overall positive individuals to create and share the joy of fishing. AMERICAN MADE.&lt;/p&gt;

Captain Wes Coward, who guides for Larsen Bay Lodge in Kodiak, Alaska, was sent four IRT Power Grip 700 reels to test and evaluate during the summer of 2014. Captain Wes used 150lb. braid on IRT’s large arbor reels and his own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.delcocheetahcat.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Delco Cheetah Cat jig&lt;/a&gt; to target halibut off the bottom of Larsen Bay. Some of Captain Wes’ thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;my-5&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I was impressed with the drag system of IRT Spinning reels. I had several halibut over the hundred pound mark this season and the drags seem to perform flawlessly. I have fished other reels in the past and even thought the drags held up for the most part, I realized there was some slippage. Seldom do I have to back off a drag with these Alaska fish and with the IRT reels, I found myself having to give a little. I think the drags are more than appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog--alaska2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fishing in alaska&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid rounded float-right ml-4 mt-2 mb-3 border&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I also was impressed with the &lt;a href=&quot;/info/patents/power-grip/&quot;&gt;[Power Grip]&lt;/a&gt; reel foot. I was a little tentative at first but found that both clients and I appreciated the grip and feel of the seat. This combined with a bulky handle seemed to work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Wes will continue to use the reels over the next few seasons to see how they hold up in the conditions up in Kodiak, Alaska. We’ll keep checking in with him, his Delco Cheetah Cat jigs, and our IRT reels.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Captain Wes Coward, who guides for Larsen Bay Lodge in Kodiak, Alaska, was sent four IRT Power Grip 700 reels to test and evaluate during the summer of 2014.
