long_description: The 600 series spinning reel is a versatile large spinning reel with equal size and power. The reelâ€™s size is comfortable for lighter saltwater duties like pier and bay fishing with a medium strength rod, but it also provides the line capacity for heavier duties, such as fighting a striped bass from the surf with a heavy 12 ft. rod.
