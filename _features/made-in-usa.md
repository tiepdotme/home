IRT makes active strides to ensure not only the team and products reflect environmental sustainability, but the facility itself as well.

The building is wrapped in a transom window pattern and includes a vast roof skylight that illuminates the first and second floor in order to utilize as much natural light as possible. Low VOC paint is used on the office walls, and high performing insulation is incorporated to maintain the building’s temperature. The floor is comprised of carpet and linoleum tiles that can be individually replaced and the ceiling is designed with exposed beams, allowing any lighting or wiring issues to be fixed with minimal maintenance. IRT recycles as many items as possible, including food compost and manufacturing materials, along with standard recyclable items like plastic, paper, and cardboard. 

Recycled compost is used to fertilize the lawn and onsite greenhouses, which are fed by cisterns that collect rainwater. The office space itself has even been furnished with used, recycled, and reconditioned desks, chairs, and cubicles. Even the bathrooms are designed with green in mind: low flow toilets, recycled content paper products, and foam soap, which requires far fewer chemicals than standard soap. 

Since standard trash bags are not recyclable, IRT eliminated them in all trash cans, with the exception of the cafeteria. For cleaning, vinegar and water are the products of choice to keep IRT sparkling. Living and working green both at home and the office is embedded in IRT’s way of life.
