<!-- After reviewing feedback that was gathered through extensive field testing, Innovative Reel Technologies has made design enhancements to our patented Spinning Power Grip™ (SPG) technology. 

The first generation of SPG featured finger grooves on the underside of the reel foot. The second generation of the SPG has eliminated the finger grooves for a sleeker, more universal design that is compatible with hands of all shapes and sizes. These changes improve the SPG’s main goals: providing additional leverage and comfortable ergonomics. 

The SPG was originally designed to provide an improved grip around the rod by eliminating a bulky reel foot in the middle of the angler’s hand. The next generation SPG continues the trend of innovation leading to a better angling experience. -->
