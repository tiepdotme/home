Our [Spin Power Grip™](/info/patents/power-grip/) technology is a revolutionary and patented design that provides critical performance advantages to fishermen. 

After reviewing feedback that was gathered through extensive field testing, Innovative Reel Technologies has made design enhancements to our patented Spinning Power Grip™ (SPG) technology.

The first generation of SPG featured finger grooves on the underside of the reel foot. The second generation of the SPG has eliminated the finger grooves for a sleeker, more universal design that is compatible with hands of all shapes and sizes. These changes improve the SPG’s main goals: providing additional leverage and comfortable ergonomics. 

The SPG was originally designed to provide an improved grip around the rod by eliminating a bulky reel foot in the middle of the angler’s hand. The next generation SPG continues the trend of innovation leading to a better angling experience.
