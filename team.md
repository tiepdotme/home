### Greg Header 


Greg has always had a passion for the outdoors and technology. He currently holds a BS in Business out of Alvernia College. Greg owns and operates Header, a fur and leather trading company. In 1998, he also founded Solar Innovations®, a national leader in custom luxury glass structures, skylights, and window and door systems. With a passion for outdoor hunting, Greg started to build and create custom outdoor fishing reel products to enhance his own needs as an outdoors man, and in 2007 he founded Innovative Reel Technologies, Inc.

As an avid fisherman and huntsman, Greg is always traveling to other destinations testing the products Innovative Reel Technologies creates to get the best performance out of them with real world experience. He is consistently in the engineering rooms testing and retesting products, which is why it took almost 5 years of development and patents to make some of the best fishing reels in the industry. Through his own hobbies and pursuits, Greg Header has pushed the boundaries of technology with his latest reel inventions and continues to develop new and innovative ways to help customers make the greatest catches.
