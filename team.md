### Greg Header 


Greg has always had a love for the outdoors and technology. He holds a Bachelor's of Science degree from Alvernia College. Greg owns and operates Header Trading Co., a fur and leather trading company. In 1998, he also founded Solar Innovations<sup>®</sup>, a national leader in custom luxury glass structures, skylights, and window and door systems.

As an avid fisherman and huntsman, Greg continues to travel to destinations around the world, testing the products Innovative Reel Technologies<sup>®</sup> creates to get the best performance out of them with real world experience. He is consistently in the engineering rooms testing products, which is why it took almost five years of development and patents to make some of the best fishing reels in the industry. Through his own hobbies and pursuits, Greg has pushed the boundaries of technology with IRT<sup>®</sup>'s latest reel inventions and continues to develop new and innovative ways to help customers make the greatest catches.
